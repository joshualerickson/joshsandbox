## Goals
--

- Leave having an idea of what <img src="https://www.tidyverse.org/rstudio-logo.svg" height="30px"> and <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/shiny/master/man/figures/logo.png" height="30px"> are and what they can do.  

- What/why, how.

- Most importantly, some applications in hydrology

<img src="rshiny_talk_files/images/freq_dist.gif" class='center' style='border: 5px solid #555;'>

---

## What is R + Shiny?
--

- R is a free open source software .blue[(FOSS)] programming language

--

- R was initially set up for exploring research data fast (S, S+); but has moved into reactive programming in the last decade {.blue[shiny]}

--

- R shiny <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/shiny/master/man/figures/logo.png" height="30px"> is built on this reactive programming.  

--

- It leverages the functional programming in R with reactive programming under the hood.

--

- This allows .blue[(users)] to explore complex problems fast and easy but also create automated/reproducible reports. 

--

---

## Why R?

(disclaimer - I'm biased; other platforms are just as good!)

--

1. R has a lot of hydrology (USGS, acadamia) and statistics (extreme value, machine learning, etc) packages.

--

2. Well organized community (ask for help it shall be recieved).

--

3. It has {.blue[shiny]} and {.blue[rmarkdown]}, which are great for communicating projects.

--

4. Great visualization {.blue[ggplot]}

--

5. The {.blue[tidyverse]}, which are packages built on an analysis framework.

<img src='https://i1.wp.com/rviews.rstudio.com/post/2017-06-09-What-is-the-tidyverse_files/tidyverse2.png?zoom=1.5&w=578&ssl=1' class='center'>

--

---

## Why is that important?

- Having packages built on this '_framework_' really helps with the **process**.

--

- Which ultimately makes **communicating** clearer and easier!

--

- Shiny is just one piece of this framework but IMO it can be go a long way in communicating and exploring/visualizing.

--

- Below is where .blue[Shiny] fits in to this workflow.

## Caveat! Warning! It's a steep climb!

- It is a programming language so you can't get around code...

--

---

## Agenda for 'how & apply'

--

- Look at some non-reactive examples and then convert to reactive

--

- Then go over some examples in hydrology

--

- Then wrap up for questions/discussion

--

---
## Let's dive in

Shiny is a way to take a bunch of tasks that are really similar except for a few things (names, metrics, styles, etc) and react to those inputs.  

--

- before we get started with shiny let's dive into the _non-reactive_ approach.

--

- again totally fine and a recommended approach.

--

- Let's explore some __peak__ flows at USGS gauging stations!

--

<img src='rshiny_talk_files/images/yaak_peak.png' class='center' height = '300px'>

--
  
---
## non-reactive workflow

Use the {.blue[dataRetrieval]} from USGS to get __quality controlled__ peak flows and then plot using {.blue[ggplot2]}.

--

```{r, eval=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggtext)
library(dataRetrieval)

# get peak flow data
peak_yaak <- dataRetrieval::readNWISpeak(12304500)

# graph data
ggplot(peak_yaak, aes(peak_dt, peak_va)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = paste0(attr(peak_yaak, which = 'siteInfo')$station_nm), 
       subtitle = paste0("Drainage Area: ", attr(peak_yaak, which = 'siteInfo')$drain_area_va, ' sq.miles'),
       x = 'Date',
       y = "Q (ft<sup>3</sup>/sec)") +
  theme_bw() + theme(axis.title.y = element_markdown())
```

--

---

<img src='rshiny_talk_files/images/yaak_peak.png' class='center'>

--

---

## But what about the Fisher River

and so on, and so on...

<img src='rshiny_talk_files/images/fisher_ex.gif' class = 'center'>

## what about Tobacco River? Or Thompson? etc, etc.

--

---

## Next logical step

--

Next logical step might be to make a function. This is a little better. But you still need to manually add the siteID.

```{r, eval=F}

peak_plots <- function(siteID){
  
  
  peak <- dataRetrieval::readNWISpeak(siteID)

# graph data
ggplot(peak, aes(peak_dt, peak_va)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = paste0("Peak Flow: ",attr(peak, which = 'siteInfo')$station_nm), 
       subtitle = paste0("Drainage Area: ", attr(peak, which = 'siteInfo')$drain_area_va, ' sq.miles'),
       x = 'Date',
       y = "Q (ft<sup>3</sup>/sec)") +
  theme_bw() + theme(axis.title.y = element_markdown())
  
}

peak_plots(12390700)
```

--

---

<img src='rshiny_talk_files/images/peak_func.gif' class='center' height='500px'>

--

---

## What about <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/shiny/master/man/figures/logo.png" height="100px">

--

Definitely some leg work but once you get it going it can be really nice.

--

Work through a simple example: 

1. We want to get annual peak flow for USGS gauging stations.

--

2. We want them to be displayed on a map.

--

3. When we click the location a interactive graph appears.
   
--

---

## Shiny code (look similar?)

```{r, eval=F}
library(shiny)

usgs_sites <- dataRetrieval::whatNWISdata(stateCd = 'MT', parameterCd='00060')
usgs_sites <- usgs_sites %>% filter(count_nu >= 365*10)

ui <- fluidPage(
  selectInput('station', 'Select Station Name', 
  choices = usgs_sites$station_nm), 
  plotOutput('peak_plot')
  )

server <- function(input, output, session) {
      output$peak_plot <- renderPlot({
    withProgress(message = 'loading data', value = 1/2,{
    site_no <- usgs_sites[usgs_sites$station_nm %in% input$station,]$site_no
      peak_plots(site_no)})})
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

</video>

--

---
## Step 2 & 3

--

What's nice with Shiny is we can add a map and click the locations from which a graph will pop-up. We can also make that graph interactive!

--

---

## Why is this important?
--

- Again, this allows .blue[(users)] to explore complex problems fast and easy.

--

- We spend less time coding and more time looking at trends.

--

- We can share with others that might not have the time to code but would like to use.

--

---
## In the wild?

--

- What else can we apply this to?

--

- Culvert sizing? Flood Frequency? Hydraulics?

--

## Yes, Yes, Yes Yes

<img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/ynRrAHj5SWAu8RA002/giphy.gif' class='center' height='250px'>

--

---

## Culvert Sizing

- How could we apply this culvert sizing?

--

- Take a common approach on the Kootenai and apply to shiny.

--

Reasons I like this

--

1. It's reproducible.

--

2. Take away Excel, ArcGIS or Stream Stats and Microsoft Word.

--

3. It's efficient. 

--

---

## Example (poc)

  <source src="rshiny_talk_files/images/culvert_shiny.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

--

---
## Flood Frequency
 
- Could we get numerous univariate distributions on the fly using the peak function we created?

--

- Sounds like a good idea but how would that look?

--

- Let's take the peak function and then use those values to calculate numerous univariate distributions (GEV, Logpearson, Pearson, Lognormal, etc).

--

- Then let's visualize those distributions graphically (density, Q-Q, CDF, PP) but also run some goodness of fit tests (Kolmogroc-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, AIC/BIC, etc)

--

- Then we can use this information (gof) to select a distribution to use...

  <source src="rshiny_talk_files/images/distribution.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

--

---

## Hydraulics?

- How could we do this?

--

- We could make it easier to calculate some common metrics (shear stress and boundary shear stress)

--

- Let's take some inputs (shields D50, particle of interest D50, hydraulic radius, slope, D50) and use widgets to calculate the shear stress and boundary shear stress for us!

--

---

--

---
## Wrapping up

--
- You're probably sick of me saying this...

--

- This allows .blue[(users)] to explore complex problems fast and easy while also creating automated/reproducible reports. 

--

- There's so so much more you can do!

--

- Have ideas? Let's create them!

--

- I hope that you can leave having an idea of what <img src="https://www.tidyverse.org/rstudio-logo.svg" height="30px"> and <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/shiny/master/man/figures/logo.png" height="30px"> are and get the creative juices going for projects on your forest!
